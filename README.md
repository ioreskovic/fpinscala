This repository contains my solutions for exercises from the book
[Functional Programming in Scala](http://manning.com/bjarnason/). 

All credit for creating such an amazing book and exercises goes to authors and whoever manages [original repository](https://github.com/fpinscala/fpinscala).

Thank you!!
